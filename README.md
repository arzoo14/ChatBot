Doctor ChatBot is an app where a patient can send a chat request to a doctor and when the request is sent, 
a chat interface will be opened. A chat bot (Dr.’s assistant) will ask the user about his/her 
name, age, symptoms and attachments (if any) within the chat. And in the end when all the data 
has been provided, it will post the request to the Heroku URL and display a success message to 
the user as “Your request has been sent to a doctor”.
